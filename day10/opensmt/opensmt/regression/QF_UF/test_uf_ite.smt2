Generated by the tool Averroes 2 (successor of [1]) which implements safety property
verification on hardware systems.

This SMT problem belongs to a set of SMT problems generated by applying Averroes 2
to benchmarks derived from [2-5].

A total of 412 systems (345 from [2], 19 from [3], 26 from [4], 22 from [5]) were
syntactically converted from their original formats (using [6, 7]), and given to 
Averroes 2 to perform property checking with abstraction (wide bit-vectors -> terms, 
wide operators -> UF) using SMT solvers [8, 9].
